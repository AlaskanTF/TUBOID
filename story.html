			<p>In a small town, an experimental vaccine was distributed to combat a deadly virus. Little did anyone know, the vaccine was flawed. As people received their doses, their health rapidly declined. Within hours, the once peaceful community became engulfed in chaos.
			<br>
			<br>Strangely, those who received the vaccine began to exhibit alarming symptoms. Their eyes turned bloodshot, their skin became pale, and they craved human flesh. Panic spread rapidly as the once friendly neighbors turned into mindless creatures that resembled zombies.
			<br>
			<br>The government swiftly imposed a quarantine zone around the town, but it was too late. The infected escaped and terrorized the nearby areas, infecting even more people. Desperate survivors fought tirelessly, hoping for a cure, praying for salvation from the rampant zombie apocalypse caused by the flawed vaccine.
